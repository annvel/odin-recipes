# odin-recipes
My first Odin project: 
I will be using HTML learnt from the previous lessons to build a recipes website. It could be simple at this level but I will revisit it in future to upgrade it with more knowledge I will acquire in the next lessons. 

Dear me:
Please don't overthink, please! Just do it. Remember you are adequate and you are worthy!!
