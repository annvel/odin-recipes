        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>This fruit salad is perfect for a backyard bbq or any occasion. There are never leftovers! This is one of my favorite fruit salad recipes, as I think the citrusy sauce really makes it. This salad is tastier the longer you can let it soak in its juices. I prefer 3 to 4 hours in the refrigerator before I serve it.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <h4>Sauce</h4>
        <ul>

            <li>&frac13; cup packed brown sugar</li>
            <li>&frac12; teaspoon grated orange zest</li>
            <li>&frac12; teaspoon grated lemon zest</li>
